/// related to the user interaction with the controller's schedule view.
///
/// If you use Swift, you may choose between implementing `SCKEventManaging` or
/// working in concrete mode by conforming to `SCKConcreteEventManaging` and
/// declaring an event type. Use the concrete mode when working with a single
/// event class to benefit from Swift's type safety and work with better-typed
/// methods in your event manager implementation. In any other case, conform to
/// this protocol directly. See the `SCKViewController` class description to
/// learn more.
